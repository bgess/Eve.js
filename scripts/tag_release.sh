# Eve.js Compilation Script <evejs.com>

# @author: Michelle Steigerwalt <@Yuffster>
#
# Usage:
#
#     ./tag_release.sh <version>
#
# Assuming you don't have any bugs in your code, this file will perform the
# following actions:
#
#     1. Run the unit test suite against eve.js
#     2. Compress eve.js with copyright notice using Google Closure Compiler
#     3. Re-run the unit test suite against the minified JavaScript file
#     4. Change package.json to reflect new version number
#     5. Change the second line of Eve.js to reflect new version number
#     6. Commit changes to Git
#     7. Create a new tag with the version number provided
#     8. Merge master branch with stable branch
#     9. Push tags and changes through Git
#    10. If a second argument is provided for the location of the local fork
#        of CDNJS, the script will copy the new eve.min.js file to the new
#        version directory, update package.json and commit/push the changes.
#
# If the unit tests fail, the script will attempt to restore the previous
# version of eve.min.js.

# Ensure that we've received a single argument.
